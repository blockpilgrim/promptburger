export const TASK_PLACEHOLDER = `Describe what you want to build or change. Be as detailed or rough as you like — the AI will structure it.

e.g. "Refactor the auth module to use JWT tokens instead of sessions. Add refresh token rotation. Update all middleware that checks auth."`

export const CONSTRAINTS_PLACEHOLDER = `Any rules, limitations, or preferences the AI should follow.

e.g. "Use existing project patterns. No new dependencies. Keep backward compatibility with the v2 API."`
